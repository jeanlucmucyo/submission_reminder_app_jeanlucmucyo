The ap is designed to keep track of the assignments that have been submitted.
It is organised in folders(directories) to make it easily maintainable
It is easyto set up those directories since all you need is to enter the name

Using the app is very easy:

You run the create_environment.sh script and enter your name when prompted
Then you go to the folder that is created, and withing that folder you run the statup.sh shell script which tells you which assignments were have not yet been submitted
